## Researching potential employers

- [ ] View the company's "about us" page
  - [ ] How do they differentiate themself from their competitor
- [ ] How big are they?
- [ ] Where are they located?
- [ ] What is the culture like?
- [ ] How are their financials?
  - [ ] View their investior relations page
  - [ ] Listen to their investor calls
  - [ ] Read their annual reports
- [ ] View their profile on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)
- [ ] What are their product or service offerings?
- [ ] Who have they acquired?
- [ ] What have they divested?
- [ ] Follow their social media accounts
  - [ ] Twitter
  - [ ] Facebook
  - [ ] LinkedIn
  - [ ] Corporate blogs
- [ ] Check to see if the company is featured on [The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/companies)
- [ ] Research the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm)
  * See what employees have to say about the company
  * Read experience of people interviewing with the company
- [ ] Try to figure out [potential interview questions](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-to-figure-out-what-interview-questions-youll-be-asked)  

Use all of the information you've gathered to write / speak intelligently about the company you want to work for.

## The job posting

- [ ] Review the description closely
  - [ ] Highlight anything that is specific to the job
- [ ] Copy and paste the job description into a word file so you can refer to it during the interview process
  * Why? Because job postings will disappear and if you don't save it, you might not be able to review it when you need it.

## Your LinkedIn Profile

- [ ] Consider adding your credentials after your name
  * e.g., mine says "Alvin Borromeo, BS (Chem), JD"
- [ ] Have a profile picture wearing professional attire
- [ ] Have a professional looking header image
- [ ] Create an attention grabbing headline
  * Note: the three identifiers people see when you comment on posts or appear in a group or search result are your name, profile picture and headline
- [ ] Customize your LinkedIn URL
- [ ] Make your profile public
- [ ] Grow your network
- [ ] Read and comment on people's posts to demonstrate your knowledge and interests  

## Personal
Above all else:
- [ ] Love yourself
- [ ] Love your family
- [ ] Love your friends
- [ ] Love your enemies
- [ ] Love your pets
- [ ] Love the earth
- [ ] Pray
- [ ] Get plenty of sleep
- [ ] Exercise
- [ ] Drink water
- [ ] **Wear a mask in public**
