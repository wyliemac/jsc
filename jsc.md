## The job posting

- [ ] Review the description closely
  - [ ] Highlight anything that is specific to the job
- [ ] Copy and paste the job description into a word file so you can refer to it during the interview process
  * Why? Because job postings will disappear and if you don't save it, you might not be able to review it when you need it.
